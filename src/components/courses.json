      "description": "eecs 281 is an introductory course in data structures and algorithms at the undergraduate level. the objective of the course is to present a number of fundamental techniques to solve common programming problems. for each of these problems, we will determine an abstract specification for a solution and examine one or more potential representations to implement the abstract specification, focusing on those with significant advantages in time/space required to solve large problem instances. when appropriate, we will consider special cases of a general problem that admit particularly elegant solutions.",
